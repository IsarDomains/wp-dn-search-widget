# Installation
Just upload the ZIP file as new plugin to your Wordpress installation and activate it. Once done, you're able to select the new widget in the Widget area. If you don't want to use it in a widget, check out the [documentation](http://bit.ly/domainers-delight-search-wp) to find the shortcode, where you can put it everywhere in your blog.
