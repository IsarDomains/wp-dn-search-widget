# Domainers Delight - Search Widget
This smart Wordpress widget offers a search box to let users search for domain names at one of the following domain service provider:
* Sedo.com (a few optional settings can be done here)
* GoDaddy.com
* Uniregistry.com

You can add your affiliate-id, so that you'll get a commission once someone registers a name via the link. To earn commissions
you have to sign-up to the partner programs of the domain provider.
