# Domainers Delight - Search Widget
This smart Wordpress widget offers a search box to let users search for domain names at one of the following domain service provider:
* Sedo.com (a few optional settings can be done here like enabling adult search)
* GoDaddy.com
* Uniregistry.com

You can add your affiliate-id, so that you'll get a commission once someone registers a name via the link. To earn commissions
you have to sign-up to the partner programs of the domain provider.

## Installation
Just navigate to the ```delivery``` folder and download the ZIP file. It contains already the latest version. Then login to your Wordpress blog and upload the ZIP as new plugin. Once done and activated, your'e able to select the plugin from the available widgets.
